          Hi there,
          <br />
          I&rsquo;m Dapo Adedire ðŸ‘‹
        </h2>
        <p className="text-xl mt-3">
          I am a <Highlight>Frontend Developer</Highlight> and engineering student at{" "}

        <p className="text-base mt-2 leading-[1.6]">
          I enjoy crafting user interfaces that not only look good but also
          improve functionality and user experience. In my world, it&apos;s about
          blending aesthetics with usability, ensuring every interaction is
          smooth and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mt-2 leading-[1.6]">
            Besides web development, I&rsquo;m curious about <Highlight>electronics, Arduino
          tinkering, and the IoT (Internet of Things)</Highlight>. Bringing physical objects
          to life through technology is satisfying. My workbench often has
          circuit boards, wires, and microcontrollers as I dive into DIY
          projects.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mt-2 leading-[1.6]">
          I like <Highlight>reading Sherlock Holmes&apos;</Highlight> adventures when I&apos;m not coding or
          assembling components. Solving puzzles and connecting clues keeps me
          sharp and entertained.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base mt-2 leading-[1.6]">
          I also have a soft spot for self-help books on <Highlight>personal development</Highlight>
          and mastering one&apos;s life. They offer valuable insights and strategies
          for self-improvement, crucial for success alongside technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Photography is another creative outlet. Capturing moments, playing
          with light, and framing the world through a lens lets me express
          myself artistically, complementing my technical pursuits.
