# How To Add A Custom Rich Text-Editor In Your Django Website

In this article, I'll be taking you through the steps of integrating a text editor with the [Django-Ckeditor](https://django-ckeditor.readthedocs.io/) package.

We wil going through 8 simple steps.
Let's get started...

## Step 1: Installing Django-Ckeditor

*It'll only take a few steps.*

- Open the terminal or command line.
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Install django-ckeditor package with `pip install django-ckeditor`.

![installingcdeditor.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651487603635/myMODzNQk.png> )

By now, you should have django-ckeditor in list of packages installed in your project directory.

- Don't fret, you can check it out using `pip freeze`.

## Step 2: Adding Ckeditor to installed apps

-Open VS Code or your suitable IDE.
-Navigate to the `settings.py` file in your project directory.
-Add `ckeditor` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

## Step 3: Importing Rich-Text Field Into Our Django Models

In this step, we'll be adding the RichTextField in replacement of the form we want to add the Rich Text-Editor. Django has many fields, examples are: CharField, DateTimeField, etc.
You can learn more about fields here:
[django fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/models/#fields)

- Open the IDE and go to the ***models.py*** file in your project's app directory.
- We'll install Rich Text-Editor from django-ckeditor that was previously installed by writing the code at the top : `from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField`

## Step 4: Replacing field with RichTextField

Now we need to change the field in our content field from `TextField` to the custom `RichTextField`.
In my project, the content field is the part of the blog that I want to allow customization for.

- Change the content field from `content = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)` to `content = RichTextField(blank=True, null=True)`

![editfield.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651490416536/AYWzlSNqa.png>)

## Step 5: Make Database Migrations

It is now clear that changes have been made to the database, so we have to make migrations and save it to continue.

- Open the terminal or command line.
- Run the following commands:  `python manage.py makemigrations`, `python manage.py migrate`

![alterfield.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651490429880/Httb3mg1r.png>)

The migration message reads: '*alter field content*'. We are good to go.

## Step 6: Checking all changes made

By now, all the changes we've made should have been reflected in the admin section if we want to add a post.

- Open the terminal or command line.
- Run the server using: `python manage.py runserver`
- Go to the admin page, mine is localhost:8080/admin and go to the add post section.


```python
- Open the terminal or command line.
- Run the server using: `python manage.py runserver`
- Go to the admin page, mine is localhost:8080/admin and go to the add post section.


```

## Step 7: Adding and viewing a new post

After checking our admin section and we can see that the ckeditor has been integrated successfully, it's time to add a new post and see the effects.

-Still on the admin page, proceed to add a post and add your desired customizations.

![addpost.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651493430992/dUYT9ojEL.png> )

- Save the post and go to the blogpage to view the it.

![postbefore.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651494311446/qbpTA0n8l.png> )

After adding the post, we noticed that the text are not properly escaped. Why is that so ðŸ’”?

> Django Templates are safe-by-default, which means that expressions are HTML-escaped by default. However, there are cases where expressions are not properly escaped.

The text are not safe-by-default because we are using a custom editor and that will be solved in the next and final step. You can chose to quit the server or not.

## Step 8: Making the template safe

This is the last and final step. We'll be making our content safe for ckeditor.

- Navigate to the template folder in your project folder.
- Then add `| safe` inside the paragraph element that our post content.

![safe.png](<https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651501925569/eE68ucIbo.png> )

Now our post is safe and will be escaped properly.

- Go back to the terminal and run the server or reload the page if you did not quit the server.

Phew, it's now working properly.
